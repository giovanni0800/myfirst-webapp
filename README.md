## 📚 About

This is me First project developed on the ASP.NET Core platform (C#)!! :)
Here I used the initial template provided by ASP, but I added some operations to get values entered on
pages like "About" and "Contact Us", as well as an easter egg.

Here I used Asp.Net core 7.0 (C#) and Visual Studio Comunity to practiced how develop a Web Application using
the techniques and good pratices learned from previous studies.
